## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- java script

### What I learned

I learned how create so many objects that share the same characteristic using a constructor function.

```js
function Book(title, author, pagesNum, isRead) {
  (this.title = title),
    (this.author = author),
    (this.pagesNum = pagesNum),
    (this.isRead = isRead);
}
```
